## Outline of The Problem ‚ö†Ô∏è

Give institutions and non-profit organizations the ability to receive donations in crypto, and spend it for their causes.

## The Solution üîÆ

An Open Source Code to support institutions and non-profit organizations to do good and help important causes by providing access to the Web3 space.
A blockchain solution that also offers a safe platform for donators to contribute to serious projects that impacts people's lives and can change histories.

## How it Worksüë∑üèª

Using smart contract deployed on the most relevant networks like Ethereum and Polygon, we use oracles to verify entities credibility, offer crypto custody to institutions, and track the use of the founds raised.

We rely on UMA Optimistic Oracle (https://umaproject.org/) as our decentralized truth machine regulated by their community to validate institutions so donators can be sure that their contributions are spent appropriately and supporting the right causes.

# How to get started
Donators can deposit any value in the institution that works with the cause. The UMA community will audit the use of the funds.
